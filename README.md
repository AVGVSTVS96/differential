A beautiful terminal UI (TUI) for viewing diffs with syntax highlighting, character-level changes, and interactive navigation. Inspired by [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) and based on OpenCode's diff implementation.

## Features

- üé® **Syntax Highlighting** - Full language-aware syntax highlighting using Chroma
- üîç **Character-level Diffs** - See exactly what changed within lines
- üéØ **Intra-line Highlighting** - Smart highlighting of changed segments
- üåà **Multiple Themes** - 8 built-in themes with terminal background detection
- üìä **Side-by-Side View** - Compare files in split view or unified view
- ‚ö° **Fast Performance** - Parallel rendering with ANSI sequence preservation
- üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive TUI** - Navigate diffs with vim-like keybindings
- üîß **Git Integration** - Drop-in replacement for `git diff`

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/avgvstvs96/differential
cd differential

# Build
go build ./cmd/differential

# Optional: Install to PATH
go install ./cmd/differential
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Compare two files
differential file1.go file2.go

# Pipe git diff output
git diff | differential

# Compare git commits/branches
differential HEAD~3 HEAD
differential main feature-branch

# Compare directories
differential dir1/ dir2/
```

### Pipe Mode (Non-Interactive)

For scripting or when you want static output:

```bash
# Force pipe mode with --pipe-mode or -p
differential file1.go file2.go --pipe-mode

# Disable pager for continuous output
differential file1.go file2.go --pipe-mode --no-pager
```

### Themes

```bash
# List available themes
differential --list-themes

# Set theme with -t or --theme
differential file1.go file2.go -t monokai
differential file1.go file2.go --theme github

# Available themes:
# - dracula (default)
# - monokai
# - nord
# - github
# - gruvbox
# - catppuccin
# - tokyonight
# - solarized
```

### View Modes

```bash
# Side-by-side view with -s or --side-by-side
differential file1.go file2.go -s
differential file1.go file2.go --side-by-side

# In TUI mode, press Tab to toggle between unified and side-by-side
```

### Line Numbers and Context

```bash
# Hide line numbers
differential file1.go file2.go --no-line-numbers

# Change context lines (default: 3)
differential file1.go file2.go -c 5
differential file1.go file2.go --context 10
```

### Combining Options

```bash
# Side-by-side with Nord theme and 10 context lines
differential file1.go file2.go -s -t nord -c 10

# Pipe mode with GitHub theme and no line numbers
git diff | differential --pipe-mode -t github --no-line-numbers
```

## Interactive TUI Mode

When running without `--pipe-mode`, differential launches an interactive terminal UI:

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `‚Üì` | Scroll down |
| `k` / `‚Üë` | Scroll up |
| `g` / `Home` | Go to top |
| `G` / `End` | Go to bottom |
| `Ctrl+f` / `PgDn` | Page down |
| `Ctrl+b` / `PgUp` | Page up |
| `Tab` | Toggle unified/side-by-side view |
| `n` | Toggle line numbers |
| `?` | Show help |
| `q` / `Ctrl+c` | Quit |

### Navigation Features

- Smooth scrolling through large diffs
- Jump between hunks with `{` and `}` (coming soon)
- Search within diffs with `/` (coming soon)

## Configuration

Differential can be configured via a TOML file at `~/.config/differential/config.toml`:

```toml
[ui]
theme = "dracula"
default_view = "unified"  # or "side-by-side"
tab_width = 4
line_numbers = true
syntax_highlight = true
wrap_lines = false

[git]
default_context = 3
ignore_whitespace = false
show_stats = true

[keybindings]
quit = "q"
help = "?"
toggle_view = "tab"
next_hunk = "}"
prev_hunk = "{"
scroll_up = "k"
scroll_down = "j"
```

## Git Integration

Differential can be used as a drop-in replacement for git diff:

```bash
# Set as git pager
git config --global pager.diff "differential --pipe-mode"
git config --global pager.show "differential --pipe-mode"

# Or use directly
git diff | differential
git show HEAD | differential
```

## Examples

### Viewing Code Changes

```bash
# Review your staged changes with syntax highlighting
git diff --cached | differential -t github

# Compare feature branch with main in side-by-side view
differential main feature-branch -s

# Review a specific commit
git show abc123 | differential
```

### Different File Types

Differential automatically detects file types and applies appropriate syntax highlighting:

```bash
# Python files
differential old.py new.py

# JavaScript/TypeScript
differential src/old.ts src/new.ts -t monokai

# Markdown with GitHub theme
differential README.old.md README.new.md -t github

# JSON with pretty side-by-side view
differential config.old.json config.new.json -s
```

## Tips

1. **Terminal Colors**: Differential automatically detects if your terminal has a dark or light background and adjusts themes accordingly.

2. **Large Files**: For better performance with large files, use `--context` to limit the amount of context shown:
   ```bash
   differential large1.txt large2.txt -c 1
   ```

3. **Piping to Less**: If you want to use your own pager:
   ```bash
   differential file1 file2 --pipe-mode --no-pager | less -R
   ```

4. **Shell Aliases**: Add convenient aliases to your shell config:
   ```bash
   alias d="differential"
   alias gd="git diff | differential --pipe-mode"
   ```

## Architecture

Differential is built with:
- **Bubble Tea** - Terminal UI framework
- **Lipgloss** - Styling and layout
- **Chroma** - Syntax highlighting
- **go-diff** - Diff algorithms

The diff rendering engine is based on OpenCode's implementation, featuring:
- Sophisticated ANSI escape sequence handling
- Character-level diff computation with proper UTF-8 support
- Parallel rendering for performance
- Theme system with dynamic Chroma style generation
